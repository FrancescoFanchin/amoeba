# Amoeba
Bachelor's thesis: a stochastic optimization algorithm to solve multidimensional fitting for bioluminescence curves.
Bioluminescent's radiant flux in bacterial colonies is represented by a non-linear model including several parameters; these are found by minimizing a suitable optimization function ("Energy").

Amoeba is a combination of the Nelder-Mead algorithm and simulated annealing method, particularly appropriate for searching minima in multidimensional non-linear functions.
